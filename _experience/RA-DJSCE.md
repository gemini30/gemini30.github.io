●	Devised a real-time detection system using Python to custom-train the YOLO model for efficient identification of guns, knives, and fire from videos as well as images, enabling immediate alerts to authorities with a precision of 95.7%.
●	Engineered a novel approach using image enhancement techniques, FSRCNN, and thresholding, boosting the accuracy by 12%.
●	Published a paper analyzing object detection models and proposed an approach for automating weapon detection using YOLOv5.
●	Curated and annotated a custom gun and knife dataset suited for detection of weapons from CCTV footage with low resolutions.
